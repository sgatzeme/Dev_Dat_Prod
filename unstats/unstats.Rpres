7 billion and still counting...
========================================================

<small>
There are approximately 7 billion people on earth. How do you get to this result? 
Via statistical extrapolation and census data.

Whereas we have learned a lot about the former during the data science specialization, the latter is a process, which all governments attempt to get a glimpse of their population characteristics.

The United Nations Statistics Division collects from all the National Statistical Offices several population censusesâ€™ datasets. The data are collected via the Demographic Yearbook census questionnaires.

Wouldn't it be nice...
========================================================

<small>
... to have a shiny application, which is able to visualize the population development for all countries in the world by several characteristics, such as country, sex and area? This is what the __unstats__ app is doing:

1. Source data.R: This file contains the above mentioned preprocessing steps and is responsible for the dataset
2. Select a country: You may select one or multiple countries in order to see the output plot of the population count
3. determine date range: Select your admired date range
4. select sex and area: Check the variable attributes as you like and see the output plot getting updated

The resulting plot will show you the population development of your selected countries over a period of 66 years
